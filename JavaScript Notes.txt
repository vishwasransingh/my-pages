JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

#JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

#To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
<script src="myScript.js"></script>

#To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method.

#Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
